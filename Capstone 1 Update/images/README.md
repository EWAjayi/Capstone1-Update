# Capstone 1

The task of this project is to build a sample ecommerce website.

Ittanna Ooorun (full sunlight) is a platform to sell the fictional product, bottled sunlight. The intended demographic is directed towards young adults seeing self-care products.

"Bottled sunlight" represents a reservoir of positivity meant to be engaged when one is in a common but dreary situation. For instance, a late night followed by an early morning or a particularly gloomy morning.
